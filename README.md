Gender Representation in Video Games

By Maggie Liang, Jessica Mendoza, Yin Ting Pang, Tyler David Takeuchi

### Introduction
Video games have become a prominent form of entertainment and a significant cultural influence in todayâ€™s society. They have the power to immerse players in interactive worlds, offering unique experiences and narratives. However, the industry has long grappled with a persistent problem: gender representation. From the portrayal of characters to the roles they assume, video games have often fallen into stereotypical and limited depictions of gender. This issue has sparked conversations about the importance of diversity, inclusivity, and accurate representation within the gaming community.

### Problem
One common issue is the underrepresentation of female characters in leading roles. Many popular video games have predominantly featured male protagonists, leaving female characters as sidekicks or presenting them through a narrow lens. Female characters have often been hypersexualized, with exaggerated physical features and limited agency. This lack of representation can send a message that women are not as capable or important as male characters, reinforcing gender inequalities.

### Purpose of Research
Our goal is to analyze the progression of gender representation over time within video games. After gaining an understanding of the proportion of men and women within the storylines, our hope is to analyze how they are being portrayed (main/side character, protagonist/antagonist, sexualization/love interest, etc.). Analyzing this dataset, it will empower consumers to support practices and storytelling which adequately represent women in a society that usually does not.

We also want to raise awareness of gender representation in video games. By analyzing the data, we can bring attention to the issue of unequal or problematic portrayals in video games. This data can be used to raise awareness among developers, players, and the wider gaming community about the need for better representation and its impact on inclusivity, diversity, and overall gaming experiences.
